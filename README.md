DisasterConnect is a real-time emergency coordination platform designed to optimize safety during events and emergencies. The platform scales from localized event crowd safety monitoring to comprehensive hazard management and response operations.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

During high-density public gatherings or emergency disasters, coordination failures cost lives. Traditional safety systems suffer from:
1. **Delayed Reporting:** Citizen reports are slow to reach responders and admin controllers.
2. **Poor Coordination:** Lack of centralized dashboards prevents rapid dispatcher deployment.
3. **Manual Resource Assignment:** Dispatching emergency personnel or supplies relies on slow, paper-based, or verbal workflows.
4. **Zero Geospatial Visibility:** Absence of a live heatmap makes finding emergency hotspots and tracking resource locations difficult.
5. **No Post-Incident Analytics:** Failure to capture response speed and dispatcher metrics leads to unoptimized workflows.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

DisasterConnect acts as a centralized, web-based control center that bridges citizens, responders, and admins. By combining reactive geospatial reporting, Socket.io-driven real-time alert broadcasts, and automated resource workflows, DisasterConnect ensures that critical incidents are handled within minutes.

### Why This Project Matters
In critical event crowds, crowd density transitions to crowd hazard in seconds. Having a single collaborative interface allows emergency coordinators to:
- Spot incident surges before stampedes occur.
- Mobilize emergency units (first aid, food, security) dynamically.
- Automatically return resources to the inventory pool once the incident resolves.

## 🛠️ Core Features

- **Authentication & RBAC:** Secure session management (JWT cookies) with unique views for **Admin**, **Responder**, and **Citizen**.
- **Incident Management:** Full lifecycle logging, severity assessment (Low, Medium, High, Critical), and status updates.
- **Resource Management:** Real-time logistics tracking for food, water, medical kits, and rescue personnel.
- **Interactive Leaflet Map:** Dynamic geospatial visualization utilizing OpenStreetMap with a privacy-safe Crowd Risk Density Layer (Markers, Density, and Hybrid toggles) that aggregates coordinates into neighborhood risk zones.
- **Real-Time WebSockets:** Instantly stream safety alerts and incident status updates using Socket.io.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Chart responder efficiency, incident severity trends, and resource dispatch percentages.
- **Resource Assignment Workflow:** Bind supplies directly to incidents, with auto-release triggers on resolution.
- **Gemini AI Triage Assistant:** Advisory decision-support parsing incident context to generate risk scores, priority recommendations, and safety checklists.
- **AI Report Assistant:** Pre-submit natural language incident draft helper classifying incident type/severity and suggesting safety tips. Built backend-only to preserve Gemini key security.
- **Incident Geolocation Lock:** Citizen incident reports enforce device GPS/browser geolocation with manual coordinates inputs disabled to prevent spoofing. Human-readable context is collected via landmark inputs.

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

DisasterConnect utilizes a client-server architecture with stateful websocket connectivity for two-way notifications:

## 📈 Scalability Notes & Future Scope

DisasterConnect is designed for easy horizontal scaling:
1. **Pub/Sub Broker integration:** Swap out local Socket.io memory arrays for **Redis Adapter** to handle clustered server nodes.
2. **MongoDB Geospatial Indexing:** Uses `2dsphere` indexes on incident locations for extremely fast radius queries.
3. **Future Feature Roadmap:**
   - Automated routing algorithms for responders based on live traffic congestion.
   - SMS backup system using Twilio for low-connectivity regions.
