## 📱 Mobile Demo Workflows

### 1. Citizen Workflow (Reporting & Tracking)

3. **Report Incident**:
   * Tap **🚨 REPORT INCIDENT**.
   * **AI Report Assistant (Pre-submit Helper)**:
     * In the **AI Report Assistant** box near the top, type a rough description of the incident in your own words (e.g., in Hindi/Hinglish: `"main gate ke pass bahut bheed hai log dhakka de rahe hain"`).
     * Tap **✨ Analyze with AI**.
     * Review the suggested title, category, severity, improved description, missing questions, safety tips, and disclaimer.
     * Tap **Apply Suggestions** to automatically populate the form fields.
   * Review, edit, or keep the suggested Title, Description, Type, and Severity manually.
   * Tap **📍 Use Current Location**. If prompted, grant location access permissions. The coordinates will capture automatically, and Nominatim reverse geocoding will populate the address field.
   * If location is disabled or coordinates fail, manually enter the Latitude/Longitude and Address.
   * Tap **Submit Report**. You will be redirected to the **My Reports** history list.
4. **Track Report & Timeline**:

3. **Action Console**:
   * Open an incident card to view details (descriptions, geographical coordinates, dispatched resources).
   * Scroll to the **Field Action Console**.
   * Select a valid next status (e.g. `in-progress` or `resolved`).
   * Enter an optional field log note.
   * Tap **Update Dispatch Status**. The timeline updates immediately, and any dispatched resources are automatically freed back into the global inventory pool.

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting & Limitations

### ⚠️ Render Free-Tier Cold Start
* **Problem**: The first request (Login) times out or responds with an API error.
* **Explanation**: The backend is hosted on Render's free tier. If inactive, the container spins down.
* **Fix**: Wake up the backend by navigating to `https://disasterconnect-87so.onrender.com/api/health` on a browser. Wait for `{"success":true,"message":"DisasterConnect API is running"}` before attempting to sign in on mobile.

### 📍 Location Permission Denied
* **Problem**: Tapping "Use Current Location" prompts a warning or fails to obtain coordinates.
* **Fix**: Allow location permissions in Expo Go app settings or manually type latitude (e.g. `23.2599`) and longitude (e.g. `77.4126`) in the coordinate input fields.

### 📶 Expo Go Network / Bundler Issue
* **Problem**: Scanning the QR code displays "Network connection timeout" or "Could not connect to development server".
* **Fix**: Make sure your phone and development computer are connected to the exact same Wi-Fi network. If they are but it still fails, start the bundler with the tunnel option:
  ```bash
  npx expo start --tunnel
  ```

### 🛰️ Android Location Accuracy
* **Problem**: Caught coordinates are imprecise.
* **Explanation**: Android emulator location services or indoor GPS tracking can be imprecise.
* **Fix**: Look at the accuracy tag displayed next to the captured button (e.g., `±15m`). For precision, type coordinates manually if needed.
