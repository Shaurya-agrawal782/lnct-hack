# DisasterConnect Mobile App

This is the Expo React Native mobile client for **DisasterConnect**, designed to coordinate emergency response workflows for Citizens and Field Responders.

## Current Scope (Phase 1)
- **Expo React Native Foundation**: Bootstrapped with JavaScript and React Navigation.
- **Backend Authentication Integration**: Implemented JWT Bearer token authorization using the existing backend endpoints.
- **Secure Session Persistence**: Local token storage using `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.
- **Role-Based Routing**: Auto-routes to dedicated layouts based on credentials (`citizen`, `responder`, `admin`).

## Tech Stack
- Expo React Native
- React Navigation (Native Stack)
- Axios
- AsyncStorage

---

## API Configuration
- **Backend Base URL**: `https://disasterconnect-87so.onrender.com/api`
- Handled via an Axios request interceptor that injects the JWT in the header format `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
