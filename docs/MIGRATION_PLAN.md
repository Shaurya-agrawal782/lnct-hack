# Migration Plan

## Overview
- **Source Project**: Python/PyQt5 desktop prototype.
- **Status**: The existing Python/PyQt5 desktop application code will be preserved safely as a legacy reference.
- **Target Architecture**: A new MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application.
- **Structure**: The new web application will reside in `backend/` and `frontend/` directories.

## Scope of Code Reuse
- **Conceptual Logic to Reuse**:
  - Authentication flow and logic (auth)
  - Incidents tracking and management (incidents)
  - Resource allocation and tracking (resources)
  - Interactive map integration (maps)
  - Reporting and data visualization features (reports)
- **UI Logic / Direct Code Reuse**:
  - Existing Python PyQt5 UI code will not be directly reused in the new MERN web application.

## Migration Progress
- **Step 2 completed**: original Python prototype moved to legacy-python/.
- **Step 3 completed**: MERN foundation created with backend/ and frontend/ folders.
- **Step 4 completed**: backend database connection and core server architecture added.
- **Step 5 completed**: backend JWT authentication and role-based access added for the MERN app. Legacy SHA-256 users are not reused.
- **Step 6 completed**: frontend auth and dashboard shell setup finished.
- **Step 6.1 completed**: public registration hardened to prevent open admin/responder signup.
- **Step 7A completed**: backend incident management API added with role-based access and geospatial-ready schema.
- **Step 7B completed**: frontend incident management UI added with create, list, details, assignment, and status update flows.
- **Step 8A completed**: resource management module added with backend APIs, seed resources, and frontend CRUD UI.
- **Step 9A completed**: interactive map added with incident and resource markers, filters, legends, and GeoJSON coordinate conversion.
- **Step 10A completed**: Socket.io real-time alerts added with persistent alert storage and dashboard alert UI.
- **Step 11A completed**: analytics APIs and real dashboard metrics/charts added with role-based data scoping.
- **Step 12A completed**: resource-to-incident assignment and release workflow added with automatic resource release on resolved/closed incidents.
- **Step 13A completed**: landing page, README, demo flow, and API overview documentation polished for presentation.
- **Step 14A completed**: deployment readiness added with production-safe environment examples, CORS/cookie review, and deployment guide.
- **UI redesign reference added from Stitch full-app design package.**
- **UI Step 1.5 completed: generated UI stabilized, invalid Tailwind classes fixed, shell cleanup completed, and public demo credential exposure removed.**
- **UI Step 2 completed: public landing, login, and register pages redesigned with premium DisasterConnect product experience.**
- **UI Step 2.1 completed: public and auth pages refined to reduce AI-generated feel and improve product realism.**
- **Role UX Step completed: Admin, Responder, and Citizen now receive distinct dashboards, navigation, page copy, and visible controls while preserving backend role protection.**
- **Role UX audit completed: route protection and role-specific controls verified/fixed across dashboards, incidents, and resources.**
- **QA Hardening Pass 1 completed: responder incident scoping, incident creation role restrictions, alert ObjectId checks, Tailwind cleanup, radius config, dashboard fake metrics, and reports visibility were fixed.**
- **QA Hardening Pass 2 completed: README, API docs, demo accounts, user guide, deployment notes, and product claims were cleaned for hackathon consistency.**
- **UI Human Polish Pass 1 completed: Admin, Responder, and Citizen dashboards were refined to reduce AI-generated feel and improve role-specific product clarity.**
- **UI Step 3 completed: Map Command Center upgraded with privacy-safe Crowd Risk Density layer using real incident report data.**
- **Incident Report UX upgraded: browser geolocation and map-based incident location picker added with manual coordinate fallback.**
- **Demo data seed added: clustered incidents, responder assignments, citizen reports, resources, and alerts for hackathon walkthrough.**
- **Repository cleanup completed: Legacy Python prototype removed from final repository to keep the hackathon submission focused on the MERN platform.**
- **Visual Wow Pass 1 completed: controlled Motion/GSAP polish, command visuals, premium micro-interactions, and Spline-ready visual slot added without changing core workflows.**
- **Landing page redesigned with fixed cinematic command-center video background and readable dark product sections.**
- **Deployment auth fix completed: frontend API clients now consistently send credentials for HttpOnly cookie-based protected requests. Added session retry-with-backoff in AuthContext to survive Render free-tier cold starts, and improved 401 error messaging in Dashboard.**
- **Deployment auth persistence fixed: HttpOnly cookie auth retained with sessionStorage Bearer fallback for Vercel + Render cross-origin deployment. Login response now returns JWT for Bearer use; axios interceptor attaches it on every request; Socket.io handshake passes auth.token; logout clears sessionStorage token.**
- **Mobile Phase 1 completed: Expo React Native foundation added with backend authentication and role-based mobile home screens.**
- **Mobile Phase 2 completed: Citizen incident reporting added with Expo location GPS capture, manual coordinate fallback, and backend incident creation.**
- **Mobile Phase 3 completed: Citizen My Reports list and read-only incident detail tracking added.**
- **Mobile Phase 4 completed: Responder assigned incident list, detail view, and field status update workflow added.**
- **Mobile Phase 5 completed: Safety alerts feed with role-based adaptive titles, mark-as-read controls, mark-all-read action, and Home screen unread count badges.**
- **Mobile Final QA Pass completed: Expo mobile app validated across citizen, responder, admin, GPS reporting, report tracking, status updates, and alerts.**
- **Step 59 completed: Gemini AI Triage Assistant added as backend-only advisory decision-support for incident reports.**

## Next Steps
- Seed demo data on production MongoDB Atlas (`npm run seed:users && npm run seed:demo`).
